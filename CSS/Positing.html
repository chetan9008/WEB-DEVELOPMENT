    <h1>Positing</h1>
    <p id="first">The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative,
        fixed, absolute or sticky).</p>
    <p id="second">The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</p>
    <p class="relative">Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these
        properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the
        position value.</p>
    <p id="second">HTML elements are positioned static by default.

        Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

        An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the
        normal flow of the page:</p>


    <p class="absolute">
        An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be
        adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the
        element.
    </p>
    <p>
        An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
        place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the
        element.
